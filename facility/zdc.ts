Traffic also flows north, against the WHITE departures, bound for BOS/BED/BDL/SWF/ALB, many of which must descend through the climbing WHITE departures. It is worth noting that, in a BOS event, Coyle needs to be aware of BOS traffic going through Woodstown, because they converge over JFK, and ZNY will likely need them spaced as one.'

Sea Isle will step aircraft down within these stacks in order to make the necessary restrictions at the ZNY boundary. The descent profiles in some cases are extremely steep, so timely descent clearances are critical, especially in strong winter tailwinds. Traffic at the east end of the sector also flows north/south head-on via a single airway, with many needing to descend (for the DC mets) and climb (from NY via WAVEY) through all of the overflights.'
